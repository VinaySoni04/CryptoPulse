# Overview of the project

I have developed the frontend component of a cryptocurrency dashboard utilizing React and Vite technologies. The dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of cryptocurrency markets, including real-time price updates, market trends, and relevant statistical data. Leveraging React and Chakra.UI for component-based UI development, Vite for efficient bundling and development server capabilities, the dashboard offers a responsive and intuitive user experience. Through thoughtful design and implementation, the frontend empowers users to track their cryptocurrency investments, analyze market movements, and make informed decisions in the dynamic world of digital assets.
